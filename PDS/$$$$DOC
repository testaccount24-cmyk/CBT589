   HSCTOOL is an REXX external function that works as an interface
   between a REXX Exec and HSC (StorageTek Robots). The following
   features are implemented in the HSCTOOL:

   EJECT    - Eject volume from an ACS.
   MOUNT    - Mount volume.
   DISMOUNT - Dismount volume.
   MOVE     - Move a Volume to another LSM.
   QCAP     - Query capacity and status of a CAP.
   QCONFIG  - Get configuration data.
   QHSC     - Determine HSC status.
   QDSN     - Get Data set information.
   QDRIVES  - Get Drive information.
   QSCRATCH - Get LSM scratch counts.
   QVOLUME  - Get volume status.
   SCRATCH  - Return a volume to scratch status.
   UNSCRATCH - Remove a volume from scratch status.

   HSCTOOL was tested successfully in HSC versions:

   * 2.1
   * 4.0
   * 5.0
   * 5.1

 EJECT function:

  The EJECT request causes the HSC to eject a specific volume from the
 library using the parameter VOLSER. The volume is ejected to the
 available CAP with the highest preference.
