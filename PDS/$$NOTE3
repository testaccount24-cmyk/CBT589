Hi Sam,

I'm sending you a little program that I wrote some time ago, it's
named HERCMD. It's a TSO command processor to issue Hercules
(MVS emulator) commands, capture the responses and display
through PUTLINE. I'm using DIAG X'0008' to do it. Could you add
this program to File 589 ?

By the way, I forgot to mention in my previous email that I've
renamed some members and deleted others in the PDS:

$$$$DOC was renamed to HSCDOC.

IGC0023A was deleted because is no longer used by DEV2VOL and
VOL2DEV functions. I've converted these programs to use UCBSCAN
instead UCBLOOK (through SVC).

Many thanks for all your great work in CBT universe.

All the best for you and your family.  ;-)
